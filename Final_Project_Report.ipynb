    "### Motivation and problem statement:\n",
    "COVID-19 is surely the most search keyword on the internet currently and the most talked topic in the news in 2020. The impact of the coronavirus can be seen everywhere. This is considered the most casualty pandemic in humankind. It touches every corner of the world: people, economy, government, school, and travel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My motivation to choose this topic is simple: learning something from the past can be helpful for dealing with the future problems. Considering this analysis, I hope it will be a small contribution to the human knowledge. Most importantly, something for the future readers to look back to be well-equipped for future pandemics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are living in a connected world. Each of us play an important role in fighting the COVID together. Tracking the total coronavirus cases daily is important. However, I want to explore the relationship of the current pandemic and the government policy responses in our connected world. That can potentially provide an interesting story of how effective our policy in handling this crisis. Eventually, it benefits the people from human center perspective.\n"

    "### Data selected for analysis:\n",
    "The dataset I plan to use is the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) because this dataset systematically collects information on several different common policy response to the pandemic on 18 indicators from governments (more than 180 countries) around since January 1, 2020. It provides a comprehensive views from many countries which is suitable for me to compare between government policies. The data also tracks the number of cases and number of death for each countries around the world. Therefore, it is a suitable for performing analysis of the government policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "OxCGRT collects publicly available information on 18 indicators of government responses. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid. Six of the indicators (H1-H6) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime or emergency investments into healthcare. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data from the 18 indicators is aggregated into a set of four common indices, reporting a number between 1 and 100 to reflect the level of government action on the topics in question:\n",
    "1.\tAn overall government response index (which records how the response of governments has varied over all indicators in the database, becoming stronger or weaker over the course of the outbreak);\n",
    "2.\tA containment and health index (which combines ‘lockdown’ restrictions and closures with measures such as testing policy and contact tracing, short term investment in healthcare, as well investments in vaccine)\n",
    "3.\tAn economic support index (which records measures such as income support and debt relief)\n",
    "4.\tThe original stringency index (which records the strictness of ‘lockdown style’ policies that primarily restrict people’s behaviour).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the indicators in four groups. For the purpose of this analysis, we concentrate on the relationship of containment & closure policies and health system policies.\n",

    "### Background and/or Related Work:\n",
    "Many recommendations from the scientists and researchers in the past few months highlighted the importance of both **wearing mask and practice social distance**. If people wears mask and practice social distance, it can save a hundred thousand lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "One research analysis published on [News Medical Net](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200926/Mask-wearing-handwashing-and-social-distancing-protect-against-COVID-19-confirms-study.aspx)\n",
    "\n",
    "- _\"The researchers found that wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with a 77% lower risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not wearing masks. However, only wearing masks sometimes during contact was not associated with reduced risk of infection.The type of mask worn was not independently associated with infection. **Those who wore masks all the time also were more likely to practice social distancing.**\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "- _\" Maintaining at least a 1 metre distance from the COVID-19 patient reduced the risk of infection by 85%, while restricting close contact with a case to less than 15 minutes reduced the risk of being infected by 76% compared with contact of more than 15 minutes. Frequent handwashing also reduced the risk of infection by 66%.The authors conclude: **\"Our findings support consistent wearing of masks, handwashing, and social distancing in public to protect against COVID-19 infection.**\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Another research analysis published on [TIME](https://time.com/5846288/social-distancing-face-masks-covid/) \n",
    "\n",
    "- _\"An international group of scientists, led by senior author Dr. Holger Schunemann, professor of clinical epidemiology and medicine at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, analyzed 172 studies conducted in 16 countries that looked at the connection between **social distancing, wearing masks**, and wearing eye protection, and the risk of transmitting the virus. The studies included people with COVID-19 infections in addition to those with two other diseases caused by coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. The studies were observational, meaning that they tracked infection rates among people who practiced any of the aforementioned behaviors. Of the 172 studies, 44 (involving more than 25,000 participants) also included comparisons between those who followed the behaviors and those who did not.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "- _\"When it comes to social distancing, the analysis showed that, on average, the risk of getting infected when remaining 1 meter (a little more than 3 ft) from an infected person was about 3%, while staying less than 1 meter apart upped the risk to 13%. The further people stand away from one another, the lower their risk. In fact, the risk drops by half for every additional meter of distancing up to 3 meters (about 10 ft).\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Both research analysis emphasized on the key points of **wearing mask** and **practicing social distance**. A combination of both recommendation is better than one. This stimulates my desire and motivation to perform this study. I want to look closer of the effect of the policies relate to both wearing mask and practicing social distance.  "

    "### Methodology:\n",
    "The advantage of this dataset is that it is comprehensive. It contains 18 government policy indicators from 180 countries. The data covers the period from January 1st, 2020 up to today. This data is updated daily. This richness of data is suitable for exploration in quest of relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach focuses on the containment closure policy and the health policy. Therefore, exploration data analysis (EDA) would be conducted on these indicators in connecting with the COVID confirmed cases across many selected countries from January 1st 2020 to October 31, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the EDA, it unlocks the insight and provides a better idea of which indicators yield the most impact to confirmed cases (answer the hypothesis). This will also help us to compare the effectiveness of these policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, time series data analysis is another method to evaluate the performance and effectiness between countries. Even though there are 180 countries covered in the dataset, it is not practical to perform the analysis for all 180 countries. Many small countries does not have a good coverage. Therefore, a selected of major countries are chosen for this analysis.  "
