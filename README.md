### Project: COVID-19, its impact and the government policy response

### Summary
#### We are living in a connected world. Each of us play an important role in fighting the COVID together. Tracking the total coronavirus cases daily is important. However, I want to explore the relationship of the current pandemic and the government policy responses in our connected world. That can potentially provide interesting story. Eventually, it benefits the people from human center perspective.
