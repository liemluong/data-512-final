### Project: COVID-19, its impact and the government policy response
### Liem Luong

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary:
We are living in a connected world. Each of us play an important role in fighting the COVID together. Tracking the total coronavirus cases daily is important. However, the relationship between the current pandemic and the government policy responses is noteworthy. That can potentially provide an interesting story. Eventually, it benefits the people from human center perspective.

COVID-19 is surely the most search keyword on the internet currently and the most talked topic in the news in 2020. The impact of the coronavirus can be seen everywhere. This is considered the most casualty pandemic in humankind. It touches every corner of the world: people, economy, government, school, and travel.

My motivation to choose this topic is simple: learning something from the past can be helpful for dealing with the future problems. Considering this analysis, I hope it will be a great contribution to the human knowledge. Most importantly, something for the future readers to look back to be well-equipped for future pandemics.


### About the Data:
The data source for this analysis is from the University of Oxford - Blavatnik School of Government. In particular, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) is the main source where it is a comprehensive dataset collected by many volunteers around the world on many diferent common policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic. It now has data from more than 180 countries.

The raw CSV dataset is updated daily and can be acquired from here:

The dataset contains the indicators in four groups. For the purpose of this analysis, we concentrate on the relationship of containment & closure policies and health system policies.
- C - containment and closure policies
- H - health system policies

#### Containment & Closure Policies
| ID | Name | Description | Measurement | Coding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | `C1_School closing` | Record closings of schools and universities | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend closing or all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations <br/>2 - require closing (only some levels or categories, eg just high school, or just public schools) <br/>3 - require closing all levels <br/>Blank - no data |
| C2 | `C2_Workplace closing` | Record closings of workplaces | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend closing (or recommend work from home) <br/>2 - require closing (or work from home) for some sectors or categories of workers <br/>3 - require closing (or work from home) for all-but-essential workplaces (eg grocery stores, doctors) <br/>Blank - no data |
| C3 | `C3_Cancel public events` | Record cancelling public events | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend cancelling <br/>2 - require cancelling <br/>Blank - no data |
| C4 | `C4_Restrictions on gatherings` | Record limits on private gatherings | Ordinal scale | 0 - no restrictions <br/>1 - restrictions on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000 people) <br/>2 - restrictions on gatherings between 101-1000 people <br/>3 - restrictions on gatherings between 11-100 people <br/>4 - restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or less <br/>Blank - no data |
| C5 | `C5_Close public transport` | Record closing of public transport | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport available) <br/>2 - require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it) <br/>Blank - no data |
| C6 | `C6_Stay at home requirements` | Record orders to "shelter-in-place" and otherwise confine to the home | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend not leaving house <br/>2 - require not leaving house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and 'essential' trips <br/>3 - require not leaving house with minimal exceptions (eg allowed to leave once a week, or only one person can leave at a time, etc) <br/>Blank - no data |
| C7 | `C7_Restrictions on internal movement` | Record restrictions on internal movement between cities/regions | Ordinal scale | 0 - no measures <br/>1 - recommend not to travel between regions/cities <br/>2 - internal movement restrictions in place <br/>Blank - no data |
| C8 | `C8_International travel controls` | Record restrictions on international travel <br/><br/>Note: this records policy for foreign travellers, not citizens | Ordinal scale | 0 - no restrictions <br/>1 - screening arrivals <br/>2 - quarantine arrivals from some or all regions <br/>3 - ban arrivals from some regions <br/>4 - ban on all regions or total border closure <br/>Blank - no data |

#### Health System Policies
| ID | Name | Description | Measurement | Coding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | `H1_Public information campaigns` | Record presence of public info campaigns | Ordinal scale | 0 - no Covid-19 public information campaign <br/>1 - public officials urging caution about Covid-19 <br/>2- coordinated public information campaign (eg across traditional and social media) <br/>Blank - no data |
| H2 | `H2_Testing policy` | Record government policy on who has access to testing <br/><br/>Note: this records policies about testing for current infection (PCR tests) not testing for immunity (antibody test) | Ordinal scale | 0 - no testing policy <br/>1 - only those who both (a) have symptoms AND (b) meet specific criteria (eg key workers, admitted to hospital, came into contact with a known case, returned from overseas) <br/>2 - testing of anyone showing Covid-19 symptoms <br/>3 - open public testing (eg "drive through" testing available to asymptomatic people) <br/>Blank - no data |
| H3 | `H3_Contact tracing` | Record government policy on contact tracing after a positive diagnosis <br/><br/>Note: we are looking for policies that would identify all people potentially exposed to Covid-19; voluntary bluetooth apps are unlikely to achieve this | Ordinal scale | 0 - no contact tracing <br/>1 - limited contact tracing; not done for all cases <br/>2 - comprehensive contact tracing; done for all identified cases |
