    "### Motivation and problem statement:\n",
    "COVID-19 is surely the most search keyword on the internet currently and the most talked topic in the news in 2020. The impact of the coronavirus can be seen everywhere. This is considered the most casualty pandemic in humankind. It touches every corner of the world: people, economy, government, school, and travel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My motivation to choose this topic is simple: learning something from the past can be helpful for dealing with the future problems. Considering this analysis, I hope it will be a great contribution to the human knowledge. Most importantly, something for the future readers to look back to be well-equipped for future pandemics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are living in a connected world. Each of us play an important role in fighting the COVID together. Tracking the total coronavirus cases daily is important. However, I want to explore the relationship of the current pandemic and the government policy responses in our connected world. That can potentially provide an interesting story of how effective our policy in handling this crisis. Eventually, it benefits the people from human center perspective.\n"

    "### Data selected for analysis:\n",
    "The dataset I plan to use is the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) because this dataset systematically collects information on several different common policy response to the pandemic on 18 indicators from governments (more than 180 countries) around since January 1, 2020. It provides a comprehensive views from many countries which is suitable for me to compare between government policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "OxCGRT collects publicly available information on 18 indicators of government responses. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid. Six of the indicators (H1-H6) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime or emergency investments into healthcare. \n",
    "The data from the 18 indicators is aggregated into a set of four common indices, reporting a number between 1 and 100 to reflect the level of government action on the topics in question:\n",
    "1.\tAn overall government response index (which records how the response of governments has varied over all indicators in the database, becoming stronger or weaker over the course of the outbreak);\n",
    "2.\tA containment and health index (which combines ‘lockdown’ restrictions and closures with measures such as testing policy and contact tracing, short term investment in healthcare, as well investments in vaccine)\n",
    "3.\tAn economic support index (which records measures such as income support and debt relief)\n",
    "4.\tThe original stringency index (which records the strictness of ‘lockdown style’ policies that primarily restrict people’s behaviour).\n",
